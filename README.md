# Stockmarket ETL Pipeline

This repository contains the necessary files and configurations to set up an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for analyzing stock market data and news sentiment.

## Folder Structure

The repository contains the following folders and files:

1. **config**: This folder holds the configuration files for the pipeline.
2. **dags**: This folder contains the Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) that define the workflow and scheduling of the ETL process.
3. **ETL_env**: This folder holds the environment configuration files for the ETL process.
4. **logs**: This folder stores the logs generated during the ETL pipeline execution.
5. **plugins**: This folder contains any custom plugins or extensions used in the Airflow setup.
6. `.dockerignore`: A file that specifies which files and directories should be ignored when building the Docker image.
7. `.gitignore`: A file that specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
8. `docker-compose.yaml`: A Docker Compose file that defines the services and containers for the ETL pipeline.
9. `README.md`: This file, which provides documentation for the project.
10. `requirements.txt`: A file that lists the Python dependencies required for the ETL pipeline.

## Prerequisites

Before you can set up the ETL pipeline, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.x

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stockmarket-etl-pipeline.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd stockmarket-etl-pipeline
   ```

3. Build and run the Docker containers using Docker Compose:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will start the Airflow scheduler, webserver, and other necessary services.

4. Access the Airflow web UI by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the DAGs defined in the `dags` folder.

5. Trigger the ETL pipeline by unpause and run the desired DAG.

## Configuration

The configuration files for the ETL pipeline are located in the `config` folder. You can customize the following settings:

- **Alpha Vantage API key**: The API key for accessing the Alpha Vantage stock data API.
- **News API key**: The API key for accessing the news data API.
- **PostgreSQL connection details**: The connection details for the PostgreSQL database used to store the processed data.

Update the corresponding configuration files with your own API keys and database credentials.

## Airflow DAGs

The Airflow DAGs that define the ETL workflow are located in the `dags` folder. Each DAG represents a specific aspect of the pipeline, such as:

- Extracting stock data from Alpha Vantage
- Extracting news data from a news API or web scraping
- Transforming and processing the data
- Loading the processed data into the PostgreSQL database

You can customize the DAGs to suit your specific requirements, such as adding additional data sources, modifying the transformation logic, or changing the scheduling.

## Docker Containers

The ETL pipeline is containerized using Docker. The `docker-compose.yaml` file defines the services and containers needed for the pipeline, including:

- Airflow scheduler and webserver
- PostgreSQL database
- Any additional services or tools required for the ETL process

You can modify the Docker Compose file to add or remove services, change resource allocations, or configure networking as needed.
